\title{Import and handling for plain and formatted text files}
\description{
A set of functions for  importing and handling text files and formatted text
files with additional meta-data, such including .csv, .tab, .json, .xml, .xls,
.xlsx, and others.
}
\details{
\pkg{readtext} makes it easy to import text files in various formats,
including using operating system filemasks to load in groups of files based
on glob pattern matches, including files in multiple directories or
sub-directories. \pkg{readtext} can also read multiple files into R from
compressed archive files such as .gz, .zip, .tar.gz, etc.  Finally
\pkg{readtext} reads in the document-level meta-data associated with texts,
if those texts are in a format (e.g. .csv, .json) that includes additional,
non-textual data.
